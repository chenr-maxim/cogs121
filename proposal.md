## Triton Transit Application
Our application allows UCSD students to get to school and around campus efficiently by providing ETAs and how crowded the buses/shuttles are.

### Our Roles
We will divide the project based on these tasks:  one member parses real time bus information from the GTFS API, another member draws the route maps given the polygon and works on push notifications, another member develops the user interfaces, and the last member calculates ETAs and develops an algorithm for that calculation.
