## Elevator Pitch

- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely
no jargon.

Our application aims to provide individuals with efficient and real time services such as tutoring, lessons, tours, and etc. all in one place. This application is created for those with fluctuating schedules.
- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

Currently, the process of getting these services include scheduling in advance through an agency or indivdidual. The current process is cumbersome and inflexible, unable to accomodate for last minute requests.
- What’s new in your approach and why do you think it will be
successful?

What sets our application apart is the instant connection and gratification our users receive in these services. In addition, our application is a one stop shop for common and high demand services such tutoring, lessons, and tours, and currently nothing is comparable in the market. 
- Who cares? If you’re successful, what difference will it make?

Our application will make our users' daily lives easier such as students who don't want to commit to a consistent tutoring schedule or need last minute help, individuals who want to learn a new hobby when free time comes up, or for parents who have a random day off and would like their children to receive a swim lesson.

- What are the risks and the payoffs?

The risk would be the applcation would only work if there's a solid user base (composed of those needing and those providing the services). The payoffs would be the providers gaining income and the individuals who need the service(s). For the developers, being able to create an application that would be integrated in individuals' daily lives because it is able to improve their skills and experiences.
- How much will it cost? How long will it take?

Users would not be charged to use the app. The cost for us scales to how many users we have whereas other applications don't cost anything per user. The application will take at least 10 weeks to develop.

- What are the midterm and final “exams” to check for success?

The midterm check for success would be able to connect a provider and individual needing the service and with a way for them to connect via phone or email.
The final check for success would be a streamlined process where both parties would be able to connect, contact, and receieve the service within the application.
